# Model

## Dose: $d_{j}$ 
For every point played, assume the player is given a constant dose
$$d_{j} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j}I(brk_1) + \beta_{2j}I(brk_2)$$



$I(brk_1) = 1$ if the point is played after a 90 second break and 0 otherwise

$I(brk_2) = 1$ if the point is played after a 120 second break and 0 otherwise

## Concentration: $C_{jt}$
The injected dose $d_0$ will eliminate with a rate $\phi$.

$$ d_{0j}e^{-t \phi_j }$$
$t$ is the index of point number 

The concentration of fatigue in the body is the remaining of each individual dose
$$C_{jt} = \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty}d_{jt} e^{-t\phi }$$


## ServeSpeed: $S_{jt}$ 
The concentration and Serving Speed is linked via a Gamma function
$$S_{jt} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(k_j)\theta_j^{k_j}}x^{k_j-1}e^{-C_{jt}/{\theta_j}}$$

$k_j$ and $\theta_j$ are modelled hierarchically to incorporate player difference






# Prior
$$\beta_{ij} \sim N(??????????????), i = 0,1,2$$
$$\phi \sim Gamma(a, b)$$ 
$$S_{ij} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$
The shape parameter $k_j$ has a prior distribution $k_j \sim Gamma(c,d)$

prior for $\theta_j$?????????


# Define Index 
Proportion of lose of speed comparing to the start of the game
