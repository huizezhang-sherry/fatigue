At the highest level of sport avoiding fatigue is crucial to success. The purpose of the project is to develop a method for measuring fatigue and use this method to study of evidence of fatigue in professional tennis.


Research Questions


1. What is a suitable model for fatigue in service speeds in a professional match?
2. What is the extent and magnitude of fatigue in grand slam tennis?
Data


Point level outcomes for all points played at the 4 major events of the calendar: the Grand Slams. Each row corresponds to a point in a match and includes information about the server, receiver, speed of the serve, serve number and the point outcome.


Method


Bayesian hierarchical dose-response model
